function App() {
  return <EmployeeDatabasePage />;
}
```

### With Custom Routing

```tsx
import { EmployeeDatabasePage } from '@/modules/HRM/EmployeeDatabase';

// In your router configuration
{
  path: '/hrm/employees',
  element: <EmployeeDatabasePage />
}
```

## API Integration

### Service Layer

The module uses `employeeService` for all data operations:

- CRUD operations for employees
- Bulk import functionality
- Search and filtering
- Statistics and reporting

### Key Methods

```typescript
// Get employees with pagination and filters
employeeService.getEmployees(page, limit, filters);

// Create new employee
employeeService.createEmployee(employeeData);

// Update employee
employeeService.updateEmployee(id, employeeData);

// Bulk import
employeeService.bulkImportEmployees(employees);

// Get statistics
employeeService.getEmployeeStats();
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Supabase configuration (already set up)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Database Migration

Run the employee profiles migration:

```bash
npx supabase db push
```

## Styling

The module uses Tailwind CSS with Apple-inspired design principles:

- Clean, minimal interface
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Color-coded status indicators
- Responsive design
- Smooth transitions and animations
