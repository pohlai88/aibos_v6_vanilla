    content: `
I've been using AIBOS for about 3 months now and it's been great! However, I think we could benefit from a more advanced analytics dashboard.

## Current Limitations
- Basic metrics only
- Limited customization
- No export functionality
- No historical comparisons

## Proposed Features
- Custom chart builder
- Advanced filtering options
- Data export (CSV, PDF, Excel)
- Historical trend analysis
- Real-time data updates
- Scheduled reports

## Use Cases
- Executive reporting
- Department performance tracking
- Resource allocation analysis
- ROI calculations

Would love to hear if others have similar needs and what specific analytics features would be most valuable.
